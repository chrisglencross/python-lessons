# python-lessons
This project contains some materials that I have been using to teach children an introduction to Python during the summer term of 2016.

I've been working with a group of 6 children (ages 8 to 11), with one hour per week.

[Lesson 1:](lesson1)
This lesson actually took 2 weeks.
* IDLE Python Shell.
* Saving and running Python programs.
* The *print()* function.
* Understanding some Python error messages.
* Values: Strings, Numbers, Lists.
* Number arithmetic, string concatenation.
* Using variables for storing values.
* *if* / *else* conditions.
* *while* loops with counters.
* Importing the *random* module and using *random.choice()*.

[Lesson 2:](lesson2)
* *for* loops
* Sequences
* Turtle graphics
* An introduction to functions

[Lesson 3:](lesson3)
* Caesar cipher project

[Lesson 4](lesson4):
This lesson took two weeks.
* Data Structures: lists, sets and dictionaries.
* Calculating prime numbers with sets.
* Escape from Stamford Green adventure game (version 1)
* Not in the materials, but we also spend a bit of time with class members
  adding their own rooms to the maze and making random events happen: a teacher
  occassionally appears and sends you to the staff room. There was a question
  about how, on completing the game, it could tell you how quickly you did it.
  This influenced the time.time() functionality in the next lesson!

[Lesson 5](lesson5):
* Type conversions
* Simple exception handling
* Timing with *time.time()*
* Times Table Test game
